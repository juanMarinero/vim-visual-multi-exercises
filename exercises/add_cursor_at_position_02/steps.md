If once I set all the cursors on any letter of last field ("cereal", "meat" and "fruit") I realize that instead of renaming them I want to just delete that field, then I can move that multicursors to previous `,` and delete rest of line:

1. 1-8 Identical steps
9. `F,` move all cursors to previous ","
10. `d$` delete all till end of line
11. `Esc` to exit multi-cursor mode
